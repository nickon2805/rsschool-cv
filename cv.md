##### About Myself:

I am in my final year at the university. After graduation, I would like to have a good job. That's why I plan to learn how to create cool websites and apps during this year! Before rss, I completed layout courses and worked freelance in this direction, completed more than 20 projects in which there was not only site layout, but also various animations created using js and jquery. Having worked only as a layout designer, I realized that this is not enough for me and I want more. My main goal is to become a highly qualified frontend specialist.

##### Skills:

* HTML5, CSS3
* sass/scss
* JS Basic, jQuery Basic
* GULP
* Git
* Methodology BEM

##### Code example:

Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number.

For example: month 2 (February), is part of the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter.

```
const quarterOf = (month) => {
  if (month <= 3){
    return 1
  } else if (month <= 6) {
    return 2
  } else if (month <= 9){
    return 3
  } else {
    return 4
  }
}

console.log(quarterOf(4))
```
